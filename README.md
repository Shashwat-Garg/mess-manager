# mess-manager
An Android App to enable students (currently only for IIT Mandi) to select mess through their mobile phones on a first-come-first-serve basis. Requires LAMP to be installed on the server end.

It will also enable students to:
1. Pay for mess during vacations in advance
2. Order add-ons online
3. Inform about fast etc. in advance online
4. Rate and give feedback about mess online
5. Choose mess on first-come-first-serve basis

Also, it will help the Manager of the mess to give information or prior notices online, and can help him manage the workers and the demands of students too.

*** Copy the folder named "folder" to the location `/var/www/html/` so that you can use the php scripts just by using your ip.***
